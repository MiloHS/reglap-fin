# reglap-fin
This repository contains code for learning financial graphs based on asset correlations over time while incorporating of regressors.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Builds correlation based dissimilarity matrices from a data array
- Learns financial graphs from log-returns and dissimilarity matrices through smoothness and a k-lag causal graph process.
- Incorporates regressors in signal estimation and learns their weights over time.
